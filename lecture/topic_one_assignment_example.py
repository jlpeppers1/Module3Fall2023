In the shell or in a text editor, write a program that asks for the user to sign up for
Programmer's Toolkit Monthly Subscription Box. They must select level of membership they
want. Each month is something different, t-shirts, stickers, figurines, even programming books!

The levels are the following:

Platinum
Gold
Silver
Bronze
Free Trial
Write an if statement that prints the cost for each of the level. Platinum is $60, each level
 below is 10 dollars cheaper, and the free trial is free.
